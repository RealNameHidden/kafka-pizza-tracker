# Kafka Pizza Tracker

This project is a simple example of how multiple Go services can communicate using [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). It consists of three small services:

- **order-service** – produces pizza orders
- **kitchen-service** – consumes orders and publishes when a pizza is ready
- **delivery-service** – consumes ready notifications

The services use the [`kafka-go`](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) client library.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine
- A Kafka broker available at `localhost:9092`

Create two topics before running the services:

```bash
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic pizza-orders --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic pizza-ready  --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

## Running the services

Each service can be run directly with `go run` from the repository root:

```bash
# In one terminal
go run kitchen-service/main.go

# In another terminal
go run delivery-service/main.go

# Send a few orders
go run order-service/main.go
```

Orders generated by `order-service` will be processed by `kitchen-service` and then delivered by `delivery-service`. Logs printed in each terminal show the flow of pizza orders through the system.

The `common/` package contains the `PizzaOrder` struct shared by the services.
